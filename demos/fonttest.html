      <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
      it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
      it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
      it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,

      we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going
      direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like
      the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
      insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in
      the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>
